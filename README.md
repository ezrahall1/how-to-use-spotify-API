# How to Use Spotify's API 
In this project I demonstrate how to gain access to Spotify API in order to write a program using Python which will show the artist name, their latest album, track list for their album, release date and album duration.

<h2>Services Used</h2>

- <b>Spotify Developer</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>


<h2>YouTube Demonstration </h2>

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
From completing this project I was able to understand how REST API works as well as learning that REST API is scalable, felixible and also caching is easier since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually.

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
