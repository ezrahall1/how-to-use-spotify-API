# How to Use Spotify's API 
In this REST API project using Node.js and Express. I demonstrate how to retrieve patients medical records, update patients personal information such as: address, phone number etc, add a new patient to the system and delete existing patient medical records from the database.
I used Postman to send my API requests and to test the code.

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
From completing this project I was able to understand how REST API works as well as learning that REST API is scalable, felixible and also caching is easier since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually.

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
